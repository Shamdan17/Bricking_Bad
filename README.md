# Bricking Bad

Bricking Bad is a fun and challenging game that has been developed by team Shawarma as part of the course Comp 302: Software Engineering course. The game involves bricks and aliens. The player has to destroy all bricks to win the game, at the time when the aliens stand in the face of the player winning the game. Additionally, there exists a set of powerups which can help the player achieve better performance and win the game faster. 

Bricking Bad was designed by following software design principles, as well as implementing various design patterns, making the design and implementation as modular and reusable as possible. Also, several optimizations have been used to boost the performance, and minimize the data traﬃc across diﬀerent parts of the design. 

The report in the "docs" folder shall go over all the design stages, diagrams, use cases, and patterns used on the way of designing this game.
